This material is contained from various sources. The material is largely based on the materials of the many courses on time series analysis held by Professor emeritus Pentti Saikkonen at the University of Helsinki. Many thanks to him for giving access to the previous course materials, especially on the course *Stationaariset aikasarjat* (2015). Thanks also to Professor Mika Meitz and his lecture notes "Lecture Notes on Time Series Econometrics" concerning the English translation.

These materials focus largely on univariate time series models, but we will also briefly consider the main points of multiple time series, specifically vector autoregressive (VAR) models and cointegration. Moreover, we will also consider some basics of machine learning techniques in time series econometrics. The empirical examples (carried out by RStudio) provide illustration of the theoretical basis. The empirical examples are mostly from economic and financial applications, but the methods are applicable in many other fields as well.

Some empirical examples are based on well-known journal articles:

On this course, we follow the following notational selections:

- We will use the same notation for random quantities and their realized values. The context should make the difference clear.

- In matrix calculations, vectors are interpreted as column vectors and we might also denote, for example, $y=\left[y_{1}\text{ }\cdots\text{ }y_{T}\right]^{\prime}$, where the superscripted comma denotes transpose of a vector (or elsewhere also of a matrix).
